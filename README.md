# T-Cell-Vaccine-design
Designing T cell epitope sequences or truncated T cell immunogens for broad-spectrum vaccines based on viral sequence databases.
"T cell epitope prediction.py" can be used to predict high-reactivity regions in the protein sequence; 
"calculatescore.py" analyzes the predictions from T cell epitope prediction.py, mapping them back to the original protein sequence, allowing you to identify high-reactivity (enriched) regions for immunogenic truncation.
